how to think about it
since we are asked to find the sum of multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000 .
Taking 999 as the last number
now the number of numbers below 1000 divisibe by 3 are 999/3 = 333
the number of numbers below 1000 divisible by 5 are 999/5 = 199
now we need to add both the sum which is
1/2*333+(333+1)*3+1/2*199*(199+1)*5-1/2*66*(66+1)*15 = 233168
